Surface wave multipathing ray tracing code published in Hauser et al. (2008), that has previously been released upon request via email in form of the mps tarball as fortran standalone applications. The version avialable here contains several improvement

- cmake based build system
- CoFI/ESPRESSO friendly python wrappers
- ability to read/write files from outside the current directory
